    "question": "Does the AI Act definition of 'biometric data' result in broader coverage than GDPR?",
    "ground_truth": "The definitions are aligned but the AI Act introduces specific sub-categories. GDPR Article 4(14) defines biometric data. AI Act Article 3(33) shares definitions with GDPR but adds definitions for 'biometric identification', 'biometric verification', and 'biometric categorization'. The AI Act regulates the *use case* (e.g., remote identification) more strictly (often prohibiting it), whereas GDPR regulates the *data type* (requiring special legal basis).",

    "question": "Can I use automated decision making for loan applications?",
    "ground_truth": "Under certain conditions. GDPR Article 22 grants the right not to be subject to solely automated decision-making producing legal/significant effects, unless it is necessary for a contract, authorized by law, or based on explicit consent (with safeguards). Under the AI Act Annex III(5)(b), AI systems used to evaluate creditworthiness are classified as High-Risk. Therefore, you must comply with GDPR Article 22 (have a legal basis + human intervention option) AND comply with AI Act Title III obligations (accuracy, robustness, documentation, etc.).",

    "ground_truth": "It is possible to be fined under both, but usually for different specific infringements. GDPR Article 83 imposes fines up to \u20ac20M/4% for data protection violations. AI Act Article 99 imposes fines up to \u20ac35M/7% for prohibited AI practices, or \u20ac15M/3% for other obligations. AI Act Article 99(7) states that for AI systems that are also products, if fines are imposed under other Union harmonization legislation, they should be taken into account. However, since the protected interests differ (Privacy vs Safety/Fundamental Rights), concurrent fines for distinct aspects of the same violation are possible.",

    "question": "Is the 'right to explanation' the same in GDPR and AI Act?",
    "ground_truth": "Not exactly. GDPR Recital 71 and Article 13/14/15/22 imply a right to 'meaningful information about the logic involved' in automated decision-making. The AI Act Article 86 creates a specific 'right to explanation of individual decision-making' for persons affected by High-Risk AI systems that make decisions with legal/significant effects. The AI Act right is more explicit and potentially broader in scope regarding the *output* explanation, whereas GDPR focuses on the *logic* of processing.",

    "question": "Can I use real personal data in an AI Regulatory Sandbox?",
    "ground_truth": "Yes, under specific conditions. AI Act Article 57 and 59 allow for the processing of personal data in regulatory sandboxes for developing and testing high-risk AI. Article 59 explicitly allows processing personal data collected for other purposes (re-purposing) within the sandbox subject to strict safeguards (e.g., functional separation, logging, deletion after testing). This acts as a specific legal enablement that interacts with GDPR principles.",
    "generated_answer": "Yes, personal data lawfully collected for other purposes MAY be processed in the AI regulatory sandbox [Article 59(1)]. However, this is subject to specific conditions, including that the data processing is necessary for complying with the requirements referred to in Chapter III, Section 2, where those requirements cannot effectively be fulfilled by processing anonymized, synthetic, or other non-personal data [Article 59(1)(b)]. There must also be effective monitoring and response mechanisms to mitigate risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms [Article 59(1)(c)].\n",

    "question": "What is the relationship between the DPO and the AI compliance officers?",
    "ground_truth": "The GDPR requires a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for certain entities (Article 37). The AI Act does not explicitly require an 'AI Officer', but requires a quality management system and human oversight (Article 17, 14). For high-risk AI involving personal data, the DPO must be involved. AI Act Article 27(4) even explicitly mandates joint execution of FRIA and DPIA, implying DPO involvement. Best practice suggests the DPO should oversee the data aspects of AI compliance, effectively bridging the roles.",

However, the ground truth explicitly mentions the relationship between the DPO and AI compliance, which the model missed. The context provided does not provide direct answers but touches on the involvement of the DPO in data protection, which is somewhat relevant. Thus, the model failed to answer the question, but the context wasn't useless."

    "question": "Are 'profiling' under GDPR and 'High-Risk AI' under AI Act the same?",
    "ground_truth": "No. 'Profiling' (GDPR Article 4(4)) is automated processing to evaluate personal aspects. It triggers GDPR rights/DPIA but isn't automatically 'High-Risk' under the AI Act unless it falls into Annex III use cases (e.g., recruitment, credit scoring). Conversely, a High-Risk AI system (e.g., safety component in machinery) might not involve profiling of individuals at all. There is a significant overlap where profiling is used for sensitive decisions (Annex III), but the concepts are distinct in scope.",
    "generated_answer": "Profiling is defined in Article 4(4) as any form of automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person. High-risk AI systems are defined in Article 6. I cannot find information in the provided text that states whether they are the same.\n",

      "context_score": 1,
      "explanation": "The generated answer correctly identifies the definitions of profiling and high-risk AI systems but fails to answer the core question of whether they are the same. The retrieved context does not contain the answer, so the AI is limited in its ability to answer."
