    "ground_truth": "Under certain conditions. GDPR Article 22 grants the right not to be subject to solely automated decision-making producing legal/significant effects, unless it is necessary for a contract, authorized by law, or based on explicit consent (with safeguards). Under the AI Act Annex III(5)(b), AI systems used to evaluate creditworthiness are classified as High-Risk. Therefore, you must comply with GDPR Article 22 (have a legal basis + human intervention option) AND comply with AI Act Title III obligations (accuracy, robustness, documentation, etc.).",

    "ground_truth": "It is possible to be fined under both, but usually for different specific infringements. GDPR Article 83 imposes fines up to \u20ac20M/4% for data protection violations. AI Act Article 99 imposes fines up to \u20ac35M/7% for prohibited AI practices, or \u20ac15M/3% for other obligations. AI Act Article 99(7) states that for AI systems that are also products, if fines are imposed under other Union harmonization legislation, they should be taken into account. However, since the protected interests differ (Privacy vs Safety/Fundamental Rights), concurrent fines for distinct aspects of the same violation are possible.",

    "question": "Is the 'right to explanation' the same in GDPR and AI Act?",
    "ground_truth": "Not exactly. GDPR Recital 71 and Article 13/14/15/22 imply a right to 'meaningful information about the logic involved' in automated decision-making. The AI Act Article 86 creates a specific 'right to explanation of individual decision-making' for persons affected by High-Risk AI systems that make decisions with legal/significant effects. The AI Act right is more explicit and potentially broader in scope regarding the *output* explanation, whereas GDPR focuses on the *logic* of processing.",

    "ground_truth": "Yes, under specific conditions. AI Act Article 57 and 59 allow for the processing of personal data in regulatory sandboxes for developing and testing high-risk AI. Article 59 explicitly allows processing personal data collected for other purposes (re-purposing) within the sandbox subject to strict safeguards (e.g., functional separation, logging, deletion after testing). This acts as a specific legal enablement that interacts with GDPR principles.",

    "ground_truth": "The GDPR requires a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for certain entities (Article 37). The AI Act does not explicitly require an 'AI Officer', but requires a quality management system and human oversight (Article 17, 14). For high-risk AI involving personal data, the DPO must be involved. AI Act Article 27(4) even explicitly mandates joint execution of FRIA and DPIA, implying DPO involvement. Best practice suggests the DPO should oversee the data aspects of AI compliance, effectively bridging the roles.",

The context, while not explicitly detailing the relationship, does mention the DPO's role in personal data protection, which is relevant to AI compliance.

    "question": "Are 'profiling' under GDPR and 'High-Risk AI' under AI Act the same?",
    "ground_truth": "No. 'Profiling' (GDPR Article 4(4)) is automated processing to evaluate personal aspects. It triggers GDPR rights/DPIA but isn't automatically 'High-Risk' under the AI Act unless it falls into Annex III use cases (e.g., recruitment, credit scoring). Conversely, a High-Risk AI system (e.g., safety component in machinery) might not involve profiling of individuals at all. There is a significant overlap where profiling is used for sensitive decisions (Annex III), but the concepts are distinct in scope.",
    "generated_answer": "Profiling is defined in Article 4(4) as any form of automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person.

      "explanation": "The generated answer correctly identifies the definitions of profiling and high-risk AI systems. However, it fails to answer the question, stating it cannot find the information. The retrieved context does not directly address the comparison between profiling under GDPR and high-risk AI under the AI Act, leading to a low context relevance score."
