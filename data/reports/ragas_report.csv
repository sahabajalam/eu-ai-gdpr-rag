High-risk AI systems are defined in Article 6. I cannot find information in the provided text that states whether they are the same.
","No. 'Profiling' (GDPR Article 4(4)) is automated processing to evaluate personal aspects. It triggers GDPR rights/DPIA but isn't automatically 'High-Risk' under the AI Act unless it falls into Annex III use cases (e.g., recruitment, credit scoring). Conversely, a High-Risk AI system (e.g., safety component in machinery) might not involve profiling of individuals at all.
